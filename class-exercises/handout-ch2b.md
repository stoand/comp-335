CE = Cost Effectiveness

### Ex1

S1 CE `1/10000 * 1/10 = 1/100000`
S2 CE `1/15000 * 1/5 = 1/75000`

S2 is `100000 / 75000 = 1.3` times more cost effective for Program 1

### Ex2

S1 CE `1/10000 * 1/(10+3) = 1/130000`
S2 CE `1/15000 * 1/(5+4) = 1/135000`

S1 is `135000 / 130000 = 1.04` times more cost effective for Programs 1 and 2
